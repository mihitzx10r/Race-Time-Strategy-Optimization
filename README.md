# 🏎️ Race Strategy Optimization using AI and PySpark

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **real-time race strategy optimization** in motorsport using **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and PySpark**.  
It leverages **telemetry data** such as lap times, tire degradation, fuel consumption, and competitor behavior to generate **data-driven recommendations** for pit stops, tire selection, and race strategies.

The goal is to build a **scalable, big-data-driven system** that can adapt to dynamic race conditions and support strategic decision-making in real time.
